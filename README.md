note for you guys: so if you are ever wondering how to delete a slash command put this in the code! (please note that this may not work for all of you!)
deleted: true, 

module.exports = { 
name: 'emotify', 
description: 'Converts a sentence into emojis.', 
deleted: true, // this is where the deleted code should go!
