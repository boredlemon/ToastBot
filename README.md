Cool economy bot by the one and only Coffee!

note for you guys: so if you are ever wondering how to delete a slash command put this in the code! (please note that this may not work for all of you!)
deleted: true, 

module.exports = { 
name: 'emotify', 
description: 'Converts a sentence into emojis.', 
deleted: true, // this is where the deleted code should go!


// used for deleting old commands just paste your old commands here and put deleted: true,
// example lol

// module.exports = {
//  name: 'examplecommand',
//  description: 'susssy',
//  deleted: true,

//  callback: (client, interaction) => {
//    interaction.reply(`this is a test lol`);
//  },
// };

// put your code below

the models or schemas folder is a super important folder! i recommend you dont delete it!
